/**
 * SECTION:threads
 * @title: Threads
 * @short_description: portable support for threads, mutexes, locks,
 *     conditions and thread private data
 * @see_also: #GThreadPool, #GAsyncQueue
 *
 * Threads act almost like processes, but unlike processes all threads
 * of one process share the same memory. This is good, as it provides
 * easy communication between the involved threads via this shared
 * memory, and it is bad, because strange things (so called
 * "Heisenbugs") might happen if the program is not carefully designed.
 * In particular, due to the concurrent nature of threads, no
 * assumptions on the order of execution of code running in different
 * threads can be made, unless order is explicitly forced by the
 * programmer through synchronization primitives.
 *
 * The aim of the thread-related functions in GLib is to provide a
 * portable means for writing multi-threaded software. There are
 * primitives for mutexes to protect the access to portions of memory
 * (#GMutex, #GRecMutex and #GRWLock). There is a facility to use
 * individual bits for locks (g_bit_lock()). There are primitives
 * for condition variables to allow synchronization of threads (#GCond).
 * There are primitives for thread-private data - data that every thread
 * has a private instance of (#GPrivate, #GStaticPrivate). There are
 * facilities for one-time initialization (#GOnce, g_once_init_enter()).
 * Finally there are primitives to create and manage threads (#GThread).
 *
 * The threading system is initialized with g_thread_init().
 * You may call any other glib functions in the main thread before
 * g_thread_init() as long as g_thread_init() is not called from
 * a GLib callback, or with any locks held. However, many libraries
 * above GLib does not support late initialization of threads, so
 * doing this should be avoided if possible.
 *
 * Please note that since version 2.24 the GObject initialization
 * function g_type_init() initializes threads. Since 2.32, creating
 * a mainloop will do so too. As a consequence, most applications,
 * including those using GTK+ will run with threads enabled.
 *
 * After calling g_thread_init(), GLib is completely thread safe
 * (all global data is automatically locked), but individual data
 * structure instances are not automatically locked for performance
 * reasons. So, for example you must coordinate accesses to the same
 * #GHashTable from multiple threads. The two notable exceptions from
 * this rule are #GMainLoop and #GAsyncQueue, which <emphasis>are</emphasis>
 * threadsafe and need no further application-level locking to be
 * accessed from multiple threads.

/**
 * G_LOCK_DEFINE:

 *
 * The %G_LOCK_* macros provide a convenient interface to #GMutex
 * with the advantage that they will expand to nothing in programs
 * compiled against a thread-disabled GLib, saving code and memory
 * there. #G_LOCK_DEFINE defines a lock. It can appear anywhere
 * variable definitions may appear in programs, i.e. in the first block
 * of a function or outside of functions. The @name parameter will be
 * mangled to get the name of the #GMutex. This means that you
 * can use names of existing variables as the parameter - e.g. the name
 * of the variable you intent to protect with the lock. Look at our
 * <function>give_me_next_number()</function> example using the
 * %G_LOCK_* macros:
 *
 * <example>
 *  <title>Using the %G_LOCK_* convenience macros</title>

 *
 *   int
 *   give_me_next_number (void)

/* GMutex Documentation {{{1 ------------------------------------------ */

/**
 * GMutex:
 *
 * The #GMutex struct is an opaque data structure to represent a mutex
 * (mutual exclusion). It can be used to protect data against shared
 * access. Take for example the following function:
 *
 * <example>
 *  <title>A function which will not work in a threaded environment</title>
 *  <programlisting>
 *   int
 *   give_me_next_number (void)
 *   {
 *     static int current_number = 0;
 *
 *     /<!-- -->* now do a very complicated calculation to calculate the new
 *      * number, this might for example be a random number generator
 *      *<!-- -->/
 *     current_number = calc_next_number (current_number);
 *
 *     return current_number;
 *   }
 *  </programlisting>
 * </example>
 *
 * It is easy to see that this won't work in a multi-threaded
 * application. There current_number must be protected against shared
 * access. A first naive implementation would be:
 *
 * <example>
 *  <title>The wrong way to write a thread-safe function</title>
 *  <programlisting>
 *   int
 *   give_me_next_number (void)
 *   {
 *     static int current_number = 0;
 *     int ret_val;
 *     static GMutex * mutex = NULL;
 *
 *     if (!mutex) mutex = g_mutex_new (<!-- -->);
 *
 *     g_mutex_lock (mutex);
 *     ret_val = current_number = calc_next_number (current_number);
 *     g_mutex_unlock (mutex);
 *
 *     return ret_val;
 *   }
 *  </programlisting>
 * </example>
 *
 * This looks like it would work, but there is a race condition while
 * constructing the mutex and this code cannot work reliable. Please do
 * not use such constructs in your own programs! One working solution
 * is:
 *
 * <example>
 *  <title>A correct thread-safe function</title>
 *  <programlisting>
 *   static GMutex *give_me_next_number_mutex = NULL;
 *
 *   /<!-- -->* this function must be called before any call to
 *    * give_me_next_number(<!-- -->)
 *    *
 *    * it must be called exactly once.
 *    *<!-- -->/
 *   void
 *   init_give_me_next_number (void)
 *   {
 *     g_assert (give_me_next_number_mutex == NULL);
 *     give_me_next_number_mutex = g_mutex_new (<!-- -->);
 *   }
 *
 *   int
 *   give_me_next_number (void)
 *   {
 *     static int current_number = 0;
 *     int ret_val;
 *
 *     g_mutex_lock (give_me_next_number_mutex);
 *     ret_val = current_number = calc_next_number (current_number);
 *     g_mutex_unlock (give_me_next_number_mutex);
 *
 *     return ret_val;
 *   }
 *  </programlisting>
 * </example>
 *
 * A statically initialized #GMutex provides an even simpler and safer
 * way of doing this:
 *
 * <example>
 *  <title>Using a statically allocated mutex</title>
 *  <programlisting>
 *   int
 *   give_me_next_number (void)
 *   {
 *     static GMutex mutex = G_MUTEX_INIT;
 *     static int current_number = 0;
 *     int ret_val;
 *
 *     g_mutex_lock (&amp;mutex);
 *     ret_val = current_number = calc_next_number (current_number);
 *     g_mutex_unlock (&amp;mutex);
 *
 *     return ret_val;
 *   }
 *  </programlisting>
 * </example>
 *
 * A #GMutex should only be accessed via <function>g_mutex_</function>
 * functions.

/* GRWLock Documentation {{{1 ---------------------------------------- */

/**
 * GRWLock:
 *
 * The GRWLock struct is an opaque data structure to represent a
 * reader-writer lock. It is similar to a #GMutex in that it allows
 * multiple threads to coordinate access to a shared resource.
 *
 * The difference to a mutex is that a reader-writer lock discriminates
 * between read-only ('reader') and full ('writer') access. While only
 * one thread at a time is allowed write access (by holding the 'writer'
 * lock via g_rw_lock_writer_lock()), multiple threads can gain
 * simultaneous read-only access (by holding the 'reader' lock via
 * g_rw_lock_reader_lock()).
 *
 * <example>
 *  <title>An array with access functions</title>
 *  <programlisting>
 *   GRWLock lock = G_RW_LOCK_INIT;
 *   GPtrArray *array;
 *
 *   gpointer

 *
 *     g_rw_lock_writer_unlock (&amp;lock);
 *   }
 *  </programlisting>
 *  <para>
 *    This example shows an array which can be accessed by many readers
 *    (the <function>my_array_get()</function> function) simultaneously,
 *    whereas the writers (the <function>my_array_set()</function>
 *    function) will only be allowed once at a time and only if no readers
 *    currently access the array. This is because of the potentially
 *    dangerous resizing of the array. Using these functions is fully
 *    multi-thread safe now.
 *  </para>
